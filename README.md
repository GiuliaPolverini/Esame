### The Double Pendulum
The double pendulum is a classical exercise of classical mechanics. I made the approximation that each pendulum consists of a point mass ![equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m) hanging on an ideal (non-elastic, mass-less) string of length ![equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?l) in a constant, homogeneous  gravitational field of acceleration ![equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?g). While the first pendulum is attached to a rigid, motionless point, the second is attached to the point mass of the first one,  drawing a chaotic trajectory. Moreover, I assumed that the motion only happens in a single plane, so that each pendulum is attached by a rigid string to a specific point.
This means that the system is described by a set of four first order differential equations, two for each degree of freedom; to greatly simplify them I assumed ![equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_{1}&space;=&space;m_{2}&space;=&space;1) and ![equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?l_{1}&space;=&space;l_{2}&space;=&space;1.)
